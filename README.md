# Local Business Cafe

This is a second project in 'Front-End PLUSS' learning path with Learning People. Aim of this exercise is to create a fully functional and responsive website for a fictional local business (cafe).

To achieve these steps I will use HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I will incorporate
bootstrap and maybe handlerail fraimworks.
