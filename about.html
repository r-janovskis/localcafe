      <h1>About Us!</h1>
      <p class="intro">
        Welcome to the Pythagorean Cafe, the perfect blend of aromatic coffees
        and mathematical elegance. Nestled in the heart of the city, our cafe
        offers a tranquil space for coffee enthusiasts and math lovers alike.
        Inspired by the ancient Greek mathematician Pythagoras, our cafe is
        designed with geometric precision and serves up a menu that’s calculated
        to delight.

      <article class="history">
        <h2>The Origin of Pythagorean Cafe</h2>
        <p>
          The Pythagorean Cafe was born out of a love for two things: the rich,
          complex taste of coffee and the elegant simplicity of mathematics. Our
          founder, a former mathematics professor and coffee aficionado, dreamt
          of creating a space where these passions could intersect and be
          celebrated. After years of traveling the world, studying coffee
          cultures, and exploring mathematical wonders, the idea for the
          Pythagorean Cafe took shape. The professor envisioned a cafe where
          patrons could enjoy high-quality coffee in an environment that
          stimulated both the palate and the mind. With a collection of antique
          geometry tools, mathematical texts, and a meticulously crafted coffee
          menu, the Pythagorean Cafe opened its doors. It quickly became a hub
          for intellectual discussion, friendly debates on theorems, and of
          course, exceptional coffee. Today, the Pythagorean Cafe stands as a
          testament to our founder’s vision: a place where every cup of coffee
          tells a story and every visit adds up to an unforgettable experience.
